# Important Info
* The schematic is called "AutoSpielSimplified.sch" 
    * This was the final attempt
    * WARNING: this schematic was made without looking at the pinout for the Nu32. There were a couple of corrections that had to be made when building the AutoSpiel (jumping wires across the circuit board
    * It is highly advised to modify the designs in order to match the Nu32 more closely (the 30 pin connectors)
* The final board layout file is called "AutoSpiel v1.2a"
    * The other files are just different versions and attempts
    * This board had a ground plane in order to dissapate heat
    * Was better than having a single ground trace
* CAM jobs must be done using the FEDC guidlines 
    * Instructions can be found in the FEDC Guidelines folder
    * CAM job file can be found in the FEDC Guidelines folder
